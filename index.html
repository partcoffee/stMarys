		<h1>History</h1>
		<h2>Rich &amp; memorable</h2>
		<p>The earliest recordings of the Church at St Mary's in Kings Worthy is around 800 years ago. Although the church is basically of Norman, it has been remodelled and expanded a lot since then. A majority of these expansions and remodelling took place during the 18th century in the Victorian era. There is some 15th and 16th-century stonework re-used in some of the windows of the south chapel and aisle. At the turn of the millennium, the church gained enough funding to build an additional section to the existing church. This is now known as the Chapel at St. Mary's. In the Chapel, the church built communal rooms that are mainly used for young people's clubs and groups.</p>
